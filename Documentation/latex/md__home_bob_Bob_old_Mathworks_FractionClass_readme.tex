\subsection*{Overview}

A generic fraction class using C++ templates for storing and manipulating fractions.\+Tested the entired class using unit tests. It includes following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Store negative and positive fractions, in fractional form (decimal approximations will not be made);
\item Can use the following binary operators on fractions
\item addition (all combinations of operations are possible)
\end{DoxyItemize}

for example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 fraction<int> a(3,5);
2 int b = 4;
3 fraction<int> c = a+a;
4 fracion<int> d = a +b;
5 fraction<int> e = b +a;
6 fraction<int> f = a + b +c;
\end{DoxyCode}
 all combinations are possible for all of the following operations as well, similar to as shown above in addition example.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item subtraction
\item multiplication
\item division
\item $<$, ==, !=, $>$ (comparison)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also includes $<$$<$ and $>$$>$ operator to take input from istream and show output in ostream

\subsubsection*{TO DO\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Need to add conditions for overflow or underflow of data types when we perform operations on fractions
\item Add More Operators overloading ($>$=,$<$=,++,--,$\sim$,-\/=,+=,-\/$>$,\mbox{[}\mbox{]},(),etc)
\item Make it generalise case which can also take care of std\+::string data type
\item Interaction with native std\+::math library
\item More optimized simplification of the operators
\item Need to add precendance for operators to calculate expresions properly (B\+O\+D\+M\+AS rule)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\#\# Install via command line 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo apt-get install lcov
\end{DoxyCode}
 If you dont want to install lcov, change following lines in \textquotesingle{}C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt\textquotesingle{} file 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 option(COVERAGE "Generate Coverage Data" ON)
\end{DoxyCode}
 to 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 option(COVERAGE "Generate Coverage Data" OFF)
\end{DoxyCode}
 and follow these instruction to build 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd <path to repository>
2 mkdir build
3 cd build
4 cmake ..
5 make
\end{DoxyCode}
 \#\# Run tests\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./test/fraction\_test
\end{DoxyCode}
 \#\# Run program\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./app/fraction 
\end{DoxyCode}
 \#\# Building for code coverage 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo apt-get install lcov
2 cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ../
3 make
4 make code\_coverage
\end{DoxyCode}
 \paragraph*{This generates a index.\+html page in the build/coverage sub-\/directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.}

Index page looks as shown below\+:

 \subsection*{Doxygen Documentation}

To generate Doxygen Documentation in H\+T\+ML and La\+T\+EX, follow the next steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd <path to repository>
2 mkdir <documentation\_folder\_name>
3 cd <documentation\_folder\_name>
4 doxygen -g <config\_file\_name>
\end{DoxyCode}
 Inside the configuration file, update\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 PROJECT\_NAME = 'fraction Class '
2 INPUT = ../app ../include ../test ../
\end{DoxyCode}
 Run and generate the documents by running the next command\+: ``` doxygen $<$config\+\_\+file\+\_\+name$>$ ````````` \paragraph*{Use file Explorer and Open html/index.\+html file to see the doxygen documentation in web browser.}

The index.\+html file looks as shown below\+:  \subsection*{Author}
